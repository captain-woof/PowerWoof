# README

This class behaves like a dictionary of lists. In other words, you can have multiple values stored under the same key. It depends on the `LinkedList` and `StringLinkedList` classes (you'll find them in the parent directory with the same name as I just mentioned).

When extracting data from the dictionary, simply cast it first to the appropriate data type.

Also, do not forget to set the cleanup to `false` for Keys and/or ValueLists if you don't want their cleanup to be handled with `delete`.
