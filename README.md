### Introduction

This repo is a store-house for some C#, Powershell and C++ POCs, concepts and examples that I keep on studying and writing about, to aid pentesters in their work. I will keep adding new stuff as I keep learning new concepts and improving upon them.

Feel free to use and adapt them to your scenario.

### Disclaimer

All of these POCs, tools, concepts and examples are shared with you with the precondition that you may not use any of these in any malicious, unauthorized practises. I will not take any responsibility for any malicious, unauthorized usage of my POCs, tools and concepts that I have given here. Any damage, of any sorts whatsoever that you cause, will entirely be your responsibilty.
